Description: This script automates the processing of satellite imagery from Sentinel-2 for the calculation and creation of natural color, false color and
vegetation indices (VI) rasters.


The following folders should be created in the same place from where you run the script:

"Sentinel2-imagery", this folder contains all the sentinel 2 bands files (it is were the bands should be stored).

"clipped_raster", this folder will contain the clipped bands.

"Shapefile_AOI", this folder contains the shapfile associated with the area of interest (AOI) for clipping the bands.

"output", this folder will contain the natural color, false color and vegetation index rasters generated by the script.
