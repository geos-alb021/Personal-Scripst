Description: This script automates the processing of satellite imagery from Sentinel-2 for the calculation and creation of natural color, false color and
vegetation indices (VI) rasters.


For the script the following folders should be created:

"Sentinel2-imagery", this folder contains all the sentinel 2 bands files.

"clipped_raster", this folder will contain the clipped bands.

"Shapefile_AOI", this folder contains the shapfile associated with the area of interest (AOI) for clipping the bands.

"output", this folder will contain the natural color, false color and vegetation index rasters generated by the script.
